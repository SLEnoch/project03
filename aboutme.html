								<h3>Hello there!</h3>
								<p>My name is Stephanie Enoch, and I am a Communications Major at Saint Joseph's University.  When I entered college, despite the inquiries from countless family members and friends, I didn't know exactly what I planned to do for the rest of my life.  However, I did know one thing for certain, that my two central my passions resided in creativity and helping others.  </p>

								<p>And so, I embarked on my collegiate journey as a Sociology Major, pursuing my desire to learn more about how we interact with each other, and ways in we can ultimately help each other.  While I loved the courses and found the content enthralling, something critical was missing, I was lacking the opportunity to be creative.</p>


								<p> I shifted my focus to my other passion, creative expression, and selected a new major in the field of Communications Studies, where I could not only learn about the way communication is growing and developing, but I could also utilize that knowledge in ways that were unique to me.  Through courses like Web Design, Film, Digital Storytelling, among others, I began to develop my creative viewpoint even further by giving it a voice and a variety of mediums to communicate through. </p>

								<p> Since then, I have explored positions that have offered me experience in how I can use my creative voice in a way that is most effective and can have the greatest impact.  For example, as a Social Media Marketing Intern at GoPaperboy, I was able to use my technical skills to help them create a social media identity and ultimately find their voice amongst the sea of noise. </p>


								<p> I hope to continue developing my voice through as many new experiences as possible. </p>
